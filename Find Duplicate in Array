Given a read only array of n + 1 integers between 1 and n, find one number that repeats in linear time using less than O(n) space and traversing the stream sequentially O(1) times.

Sample Input:

[3 4 1 4 1]
Sample Output:

1


solution:

def repeatedNumber(self, A):

    d=dict()
    for i in A:
        if i in d:
            return i
        else:
            d[i]=1
            
    return -1
